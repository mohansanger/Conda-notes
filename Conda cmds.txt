1.Create an environment
	conda create -n envName python=version #--name and -n are same, --envs and -e are the same. conda --help or conda -h , both are same
	conda create --name snowflakes biopython #this will same same version of python
        
2.Change environments (activate/deactivate)
        conda active envName #Environments are installed by default into the envs directory in your conda directory
        conda deactivate

3.List all environments
	conda info --envs or conda info -e or conda env list

4.Verify current environment
	conda info --envs or conda info -e or conda env list # current environment highlighted with an '*' character

5.Remove an environment

6.Share an environment
         environment.yml #share your environment with another person, so they can re-create a test.
         with all of its packages and versions, give them a copy of your environment.yml file.

7.Export the environment file
	 conda env export > environment.yml # This file handles the environment's pip packages as well as its conda packages
         Email or copy the exported environment.yml file to the other person
	 The other person will then need to create the environment by the following command:
	 conda env create -f environment.yml

8.Create environment file by hand
