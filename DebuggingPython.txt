Debugging techniques with PDB:
pdb.set_trace(): Insert this line within your code to pause execution and enter the debugger at that point. 
n (next): Execute the next line of code 
s (step): Step into a function call 
r (return): Continue execution until the current function returns 
p variable_name: Print the value of a variable
